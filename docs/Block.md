## Description

A **block** is an element that flows through the different **[regions](Region)** on a page (think of a region as a column). These elements flow in the same order as they appear in the original article. When there's no more room in a region, it simply flows into the next one.

While [figures](Figure) have specific positions in templates, blocks flow naturally without having to worry about where they end up.


## Examples

Typical examples of blocks are paragraphs, factboxes, quotes, etc.

```html
<p>I am a block</p>
<blockquote>I am a block as well</blockquote>
```
